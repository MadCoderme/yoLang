A very simple idea of "Programming language" written using Javascript on Web

Hi fellow **engineers**! ðŸ‘‹

A lot of programmers have the dream to create their own Programming Language. To be honest, this is not an easy deal, especially if you are just starting to learn this thing called "Coding".

**Yo** (Don't mess up with YODev) is a project built to have fun. It is not a serious language. I even struggle to call it a language because
- It translates code to Javascript
- It runs on a HTML file
- Yes, The compiler lives in a HTML file

Anyway, please consider this as a project to think in a new way, to get new experience and to spend time in another fun project.

## How does it work?
There are three parts -

- **Input TextArea:** This takes the code as input (No code formatting sadly)
- **Output Area:** This is where the output is displayed along with compiling information. You can think this as a Console.
- **Compiler:** Every language needs a compiler or interpreter to translate your code to something that computer can understand. This part of the project translates the Yo code to Javascript. Yo Compiler goes line by line and converts the code to executable programme.

## Syntax
I love the syntax of C++, C#, Java and Javascript. I also like the simplicity of Python.
So, I decided to make the syntax a combination of those.

### Data Types
Yo has support for all those Data types you can see in the languages mention above.

```
10                            // This is a number
'Hello world'                 // This is a String. Strings must be inside single quotation. 
true                          // This is a boolean value
[1, 2, 3]                     // This is an Array
{ name: 'Yo', age: '1 Day' }  // This is an Object

```

### Mathematical Operations
You can expect the most basic stuffs here only. So, Yo offers you all those basic operations -

```
1 + 1
2 - 1
5 * 6
8 / 2
```

### Variable Declaration
To declare a variable, you need to use the keyword `#` - 

```
#a = 10
#b = 20
```

Remember, Yo is very sensitive about spaces at this moment. So you must put those two spaces, before and after the equal(=) sign.

You can also declare constants. To do this, you need to use the keyword `c#`

```
c#SuperImportantVal = 'A constant value'
```

To update the value of a variable, you can simply write this - 

```
#a = 'Hello'
a = 'Hello world'
```
